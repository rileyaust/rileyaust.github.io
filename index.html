        <p>As a Project Management Intern at InBrace, I mediated communication between Raven 360 Consulting and InBrace to prepare Learning.InBrace.com launch.

I presented the launch plan to executives and VPs to gain buy-in and approvals, identified software-related issues during the pilot, and created SOPs for Inside Sales, Training, and Clinical education to create enduring processes.</p>
