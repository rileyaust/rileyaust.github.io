        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <h3>Project Management Intern at InBrace</h3>
        <p>For a summer internship, I mediated communication between Raven 360 Consulting and InBrace to prepare <a href="https://learning.inbrace.com/">Learning.InBrace.com</a> launch. 
            I beta tested, piloted, and launched InBrace.Learning.com for 450+ internal/external users. 
            Additionally, I was responsible for managing all data related to the site to ensure collection and automation of previously manual processes. 
            I presented the launch plan to executives and VPs to gain buy-in and approvals, identified software-related issues during the pilot, and created SOPs for Inside Sales, Training, and Clinical education to create enduring processes.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Why "X-Men: Days of Future Past" is a Statistical Anomaly on Letterboxd</h3>
        <p>I have a large passion for film and with that, I use the app Letterboxd to often find new movies to watch. 
            One great feature of the app is the way in which statistics about total watches and ratings are collected across all users. 
            This made me curious to find that "X-Men: Days of Future Past", despite being the 5th entry and debuting 14 years after the original, is the most viewed entry in the "X-Men" franchise.
        </p>
        <p>
            This led to me creating my own statistic to measure this kind of anomaly that was found in the X-Men franchise. 
            The way in which I created this obscurity score was by this equation: 
        </p>

        <p>
            number of viewers / expected viewers * entry number / relative viewership rank 
        </p>

        <p>
            RVR is the ranking of the movie in relation to the ones released up to that point. 
            I did it like this because I would expect that each entry in a franchise would have fewer views than the one before it.
            For example, "X2" has 708k viewers with an expected value of 824k and an entry number of 2 and a relative rank of 2 as well, giving it a very normal score of 0.859.
            I also calculated the expected value by taking the average in difference in views between each entry.
        </p>
        <p>
