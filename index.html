        <h3>Project Management Intern at InBrace</h3>
        <p>For a summer internship, I mediated communication between Raven 360 Consulting and InBrace to prepare <a href="https://learning.inbrace.com/">Learning.InBrace.com</a> launch. 
            I beta tested, piloted, and launched InBrace.Learning.com for 450+ internal/external users. 
            Additionally, I was responsible for managing all data related to the site to ensure collection and automation of previously manual processes. 
            I presented the launch plan to executives and VPs to gain buy-in and approvals, identified software-related issues during the pilot, and created SOPs for Inside Sales, Training, and Clinical education to create enduring processes.

        <h3>
            Creating a Social Media Database in SQL</h3>

        <p>
            One project I worked on in my database class required designing and implementing a relational database for social media platform. 
            The project involved creating an ER Diagram based on the platform's business rules, developing SQL scripts to create and drop tables, and writing sequences and triggers to enforce complex constraints. 
            We then populated the database with data from a provided public dataset using SQL DML statements, ensuring data integrity through validation. 
            Additionally, I created views to represent the data in specific formats, matching the schema of the external dataset. 
            Through this project, I learned to translate business rules into database design, implement SQL DDL and DML commands, and ensure data integrity and accurate representation with views.

        <h3>
            Using MiniMax for Game AI
        </h3>

        <p>
            I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect-4 A.I. using Python, focusing on implementing the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 
            I began by setting up the development environment, installing necessary libraries such as numpy and pygame. 
            The core task was to complete the minimax function in Agent.py, ensuring it could predict optimal moves efficiently for both games. 
            Testing involved running provided test cases and verifying the AI's performance using both terminal outputs for TTT and visual simulations for C4. 
            Through this project, I deepened my understanding of game theory, algorithm optimization, and practical application of Python for AI development.

        <h3>
            What streaming service is the best deal?
        </h3>

        <p>
            According to Forbes, 99% of US households subscribe to a streaming service. 
            Whether that be Netflx, Hulu, Max, or another one of the many that now exist on the market, Americans are careful about which ones they select. 
            Outside of picking the ones which have the exclusives you specifically want to see, I believe brand recognition is the driving part of why some are more popular than others.
            This is what made me curious to see what sevice actually was the best in relation to their costs per month for with ads and without. 
            In order to quantify the quality of a streaming service in relation to its movie selections, I used a variety of lists on Letterboxd that I thought would encompass all aspects when having a great movie library.
        </p>

        <P>
            The services I decided to test included Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Max, Paramount+, Hulu, Peacock, AppleTV+, Starz, Tubi and Mubi. 
            Despite being the most popular streaming service, Netflix ranked 7th, behind ones such as Paramount+. 
            The only categories Netflix placed in the top three in were total films and 500 most watched films. 
            Netflix also had the third most amount of bottom 250 films, which I used as a negative factor in my scoring equation. 
        </P>

        <p>
            Max on the other hand, Max preformed amazingly.
            It finsihed first in total films from 4 of the 6 lists I selected from, with it only being in fifth place for total number of films.
            This led me to also study the bundles for which Max is apart of, which combines it with Disney+ and Hulu. 
            When adding these bundles as their own individual services to the data set, they preformed the best and had the highest score of service.
            This was despite Hulu originally coming in as ninth best because of the great price you can get all three for $16.99 with ads and $29.99 without.
        </p>

        <p>
            The original reason why I tested this was because of a service called Tubi, which unlike all the other ones I tested, is free.
            Despite this, Tubi finished in second only behind Max due its large library and huge amount of older content as well. 
            This project was not only to show the best value for all the popular services, but to also show that many of the free ones such as Tubi are quite impressive as well. 
            I understand this is not a comprehensive analysis, as this does not consider the value of exclusives or TV shows as whole, which would have benefited Hulu for example, which was ranked in the lower half.

        <h3>Why "X-Men: Days of Future Past" is a Statistical Anomaly on Letterboxd</h3>
        <p>I have a large passion for film and with that, I use the app Letterboxd to often find new movies to watch. 
            One great feature of the app is the way in which statistics about total watches and ratings are collected across all users. 
            This made me curious to find that "X-Men: Days of Future Past", despite being the 5th entry and debuting 14 years after the original, is the most viewed entry in the "X-Men" franchise.
        </p>
        <p>
            This led to me creating my own statistic to measure this kind of anomaly that was found in the X-Men franchise. 
            The way in which I created this obscurity score was by this equation: 
        </p>

        <p>
            number of viewers / expected viewers * entry number / relative viewership rank 
        </p>

        <p>
            RVR is the ranking of the movie in relation to the ones released up to that point. 
            I did it like this because I would expect that each entry in a franchise would have fewer views than the one before it.
            For example, "X2" has 708k viewers with an expected value of 824k and an entry number of 2 and a relative rank of 2 as well, giving it a very normal score of 0.859.
            I also calculated the expected value by taking the average in difference in views between each entry.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Serious Game Development</h3>
        <p>During my study abroad course in Summer 2022, I developed a serious game from scratch in Unity with 2 other students. 
            Throughout the course, we were taught by Benno Lüders, a game developer from Germany, who showed us not only the technical aspects of creating a game, but how they can be used in educational settings as well.
            We mostly utilized Unity and C#, which were both entirely new to me when I started the course.
            Our final project was a racing game that highlighted the dangers of driving under the influnece.
            We programed it so the speed and handles would be correlated with the amount of drinks the user selected beforehand, which was supposed to have a similar effect seen in impairment goggles. 
            This project enhanced my skills in game development, team collaboration, and programming in Unity which is a standard in the gaming industry.
